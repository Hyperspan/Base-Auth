## Introduction

Authentication and authorization are fundamental aspects of many web applications. This project demonstrates how to set up a .NET Core application with Identity Framework to manage user authentication and authorization. PostgreSQL is used as the database for storing user information and related data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for C# development.
- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core) installed.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database server installed.

## Getting Started

1. Set up your PostgreSQL database and update the connection string in `appsettings.json` to point to your database.

2. Open the solution in your preferred development environment (e.g., Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code).

3. Build and run the application.

## Features
